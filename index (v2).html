        <h3>Xploration App</h3>
        <p>Xploration is an app for those who have lived in the same are for a while and want to learn more about their surrounding, and/or for those who just moved somewhere and are looking to explore the new area. The app is for anyone who wants to go out to eat at a new place, hike or walk around exploring new views, go dance the night away, or simply meet some locals. Xploration lets you chat, plan activities and make memories with your friends or new people with similar interests.
        </p>
        <p>Through the design process of this app I covered end-to-end concepts including user research, competitive analysis, user surveys and user interviews, personas and user flows, journey mapping, low, medium, and high fidelity wireframing, usability testing and prototyping.
